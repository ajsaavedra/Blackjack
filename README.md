# Blackjack

This is a Blackjack implementation done entirely in Java. Using an array of standard cards, the game instantiates a deck to shuffle and lay on panels.

## Building

In Eclipse go to: File/New/Project. Select Java.

Eclipse will display a warning that says that your project "overlaps the location of another project".

Re-select "Use default location," and now Eclipse will let you click on the "Next" button to continue configuration of your project.

## How to play
Once a new game is created, shuffle the deck to begin the game, wherein the object is to try to reach a hand value of 21 without going over.

Players can play as many times until the deck is out of cards. At that point, simply reshuffle the deck and begin again.
